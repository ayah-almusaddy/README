# about me

Hi, Iâ€™m Ayah â€” a software engineer passionate about building meaningful projects that combine creativity and technical problem-solving. I have experience working in startup environments where Iâ€™ve learned to move fast, adapt, and take ownership of my work.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m an avid reader and writer with a strong interest in neuroscience and psychology â€” fields that inspire me to understand how people think and make decisions. Iâ€™ve also worked with children, which has strengthened my communication skills, patience, and adaptability.

You can find my work across several repositories focused on data science, machine learning, and AI projects, including my Fall AI Studio project, which Iâ€™ve pinned to highlight my most relevant experience.

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out to connect!
